<p>After an event of earthquake the repair of structure and loss of non-structural components may be a more costly affair than installing base. Base isolation has become a major feature of structural design in the past few decades. This structure has 3 stories above ground level and 3 stories below. Chris Gannon and Dr Bill Robinson of Robinson Seismic explain the base isolation principle. Basic design procedures are presented including determination of design earthquake forces modelling of base-isolation layers modelling of the superstructure selection of ground motions time-history analyses and performance criteria.</p>

<p>Combined with the concrete facts of base isolation technique in China. Design of the seismic isolation system includes dete rmination of the base shear bearing displacement etc in accordance with the site-specific conditions by code provisions at desired bearing. Base isolators act on well-understood physical principles such as energy oscillation and damping. Additionally top floor acceleration is also an important parameter for the sensitive especially high-frequency equipments housed inside the PS.

<p>The economy of base isolation is not viewed in terms of its initial installment but over the design period of the structure during which it is expected to experience earthquake. Base shear is used for the design of the base-isolation system and the FBPS. In layman terms base isolation can be understood by comparing it to suspension system used in automobiles. The project was the terminal of Kunming Changshui International Airport which covers an area of 548000m² with the tallest point being 7225m.

The main content of base isolation structure design consists of two parts. Base isolation is a state-of-the-art method in which the structure superstructure is separated from the base foundation or substructure by introducing a suspension system between the base and the main structure.
