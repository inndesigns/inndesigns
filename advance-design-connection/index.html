<p>We will explicitly check the tensile strength of bolts. Design focused CM component model is compared to FEM finite elements models. Part of Advance Design the Steel Connection module ensures the configuration of a seamless solution with the ability to manage and calculate bolted and welded joints and with fully detailed design reports that include the calculation formulas and reference to the design code. For Steel structures Advance Design is an integrated software allowing to perform global FEM analysis design and optimization of steel members local analysis with check and optimization of standards 2D connectionsWhen it comes to 3D complex steel connections Advance Design can be completed with the module IDEA StatiCa Connection to handle such connections.
