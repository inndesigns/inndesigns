<p>Consequently Li-ion battery makers prescribe a strict charging regimen to protect their products from damage. In the electrodes the pore electrolyte is in contact with the electrolyte in the separator. Most modern products there is still a risk in overcharging because it is a direct result of the physical make-up of the cell. Another consideration in cell design is the amount of heat generated in the cell.</p>
