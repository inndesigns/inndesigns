<p><strong>Air Pollution In Our Homes</strong>, The rise of chemicals in our home products is probably why we are seeing the rise of indoor air pollution. Because we spend roughly 90 percent of our time indoors and as much as 70 percent of that time is indoors in our homes it is important that we pay closer attention to. I t is particularly important to understand levels of pollution in our houses because it is where we tend to spend most of our time so any health effects are likely to be more significant There is some speculation that a lot of the microplastics might be coming from textiles and that their distribution might be affected by ventilation and the age of the building. Ground-level ozone various forms of carbon nitrogen oxides sulfur oxides volatile organic compounds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and fine particulate matter.</p>

<p>Even as weve worked to reduce our climate and air pollution by cutting down on vehicle use and using clean fossil free sources for our electricity we continue to use fossil fuels like fossil gas still called natural gas by the gas industry to heat and power our homesraising our greenhouse gas emissions and dirtying our air. Many people are aware of outdoor pollution but not many people. Dirt dust mould chemicals even plasticspolystyrene and electronics all contribute to the toxins in our air.

<p>Even as weve worked to reduce our climate and air pollution by cutting down on vehicle use and using clean fossil free sources for our electricity we continue to use fossil fuels like fossil gas still called natural gas by the gas industry to heat and power our homesraising our greenhouse gas emissions and dirtying our air. During the first phase of the study researchers from the University of Leeds will work with 40 families from Bradford in West Yorkshire to measure the level of microplastics caught in sampling devices placed inside their houses. Cooking and heating with polluting fuels and technologies produces high levels of household air pollution which includes a range of health damaging pollutants such as fine particles and carbon monoxide. Studies have shown that the air in our homes can be even more polluted than outdoor air. Indoor Pollution Are You Really Safe Inside Your Home Indoor Air Indoor Air Pollution Indoor.</p>
