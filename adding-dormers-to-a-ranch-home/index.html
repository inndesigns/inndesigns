<p>Painted shake cedar shingles found elsewhere on the homes exterior make the dormer addition appear original to the residence. The addition of a bay window to the right of the front door increases the symmetry of the building. Adding one or more dormers in an area of your home where you need additional headroom space and light is an affordable solution. Dormer windows got the name because they refer to sleeping areas eg.

Dormer windows got the name because they refer to sleeping areas eg. Here the addition of a shed dormer to an attic space not only floods the once-dark room with light but also provides much-needed headroom.
