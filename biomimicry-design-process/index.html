The terms biomimicry and biomimetics come from the Greek words bios meaning life and mimesis meaning to imitate.

<p>The Biomimicry Design Spiral is a step-by-step process for turning natures strategies into innovative and sustainable design solutions. Identifies a specific trait in an organism and translates that into a design that responds to a human problem. Utilizing biomimicry as an approach to the design process happens in one of 2 directions 1. This study asserts that the practice of interior design should add a biomimicry phase to its design process and should biologize its design problems by using natures time-tested principles and methods.

Biomimicry and decide whether they are going to design a building a system or some other product for use on the moon that incorporates biomimicry. There are three types of biomimicry - one is copying form and shape another is copying a process like photosynthesis in a leaf and the third is mimicking at an ecosystems level like building a nature-inspired city.

<p>A Unique Art of Mimicking. Teams next develop a detailed drawing showing their product or system from at least two perspectives and including a written description of how the design works. Now that you have a sense for what a biomimetic approach looks like lets consider how some of the concepts and tools of biomimicry can be integrated into other design frameworks by looking at two that are widely used in design and engineering.
