<p>One-design high performance wing sail catamaran. For the AC World Series and the Americas Cup Match races will start when the wind is between 5 and 33 knots. Building on our work with aero and hydro analysis for the fixed wing catamarans in the last Cup 2017 we adapted Membrain to a softwing concept to create a simulation for full analysis of new boat loads rigging sails. The one-design wing for the AC45 is a scaled-down version of the mammoth sail used to win the 33rd Americas Cup but designing it is by no means simple.</p>
