<p><strong>Are Pokemon Designs Copyrighted</strong>, In the United States a character is automatically copyrighted as long as it is original meaning it has to involve an element of creativity that is unique and distinguishable. Other examples include Gloom possibly Seel Abra Kadabra Alakazam Golem and Weezing Ekans Arbok and Rotom are words spelled backwards. Free for commercial use No attribution required High quality images. The newer art style is cuter and sleeker while the original aesthetic had a bit more character.</p>

<p>Famous franchise movie characters like Rambo Snake Plisskin and RoboCop are protected by copyright law because of the copyright in the film and script but only to the extent of the creative expression by the author. While this isnt strictly allowed its seen as a little more acceptable. Pikachu maybe but the Pokemon logo is whats protected by trademark. Going to flag this question for now as it has more to do with copyright than it does Pokemon however Ill still provide an answer that I believe is correct here.</p>

<p>However there have been cases of games being taken down by copyright infringement or being forced to rebrand the game to something non-copyrighted usually if the game makes revenue. No you as an individual dont usually have a license to take a copyrighted image and put it on a custom T-shirt and thats why they prohibit it without a letter or certificate proving that the use is permitted. A lot of the designs on Redbubble can get away with what theyre doing as they are completely custom art produced by the artist that just happen to be of a Pokemonother character. Simple designs do not qualify as original. Consequently any use of a gun-toting cyborg wont be.</p>
