<p>Made mostly of air aerogels are starting to be used for building insulation. Lots of tech stuff but there exist several processes one produces hydrophylic the others hydrophobic. How is R value calculated. Aerogels are good thermal insulators because they almost nullify two of the three methods of heat transfer convection conduction and radiation.</p>
