<p>As the water is distributed over the internal packing media it is broken up into small droplets which create a tremendous amount of surface. They are briefly described below. The overall basis for design of the counter-current packed-bed air stripping tower is presented in Section 103 of Process. Typical Air Stripping System Air stripping is a full-scale technology in which volatile organics are partitioned from ground water by greatly increasing the surface area of the contaminated water exposed to air. It is often easier and less expensive to remove nitrogen from wastewater in the form of ammonia than to convert it to.</p>

<p>Many studies have recommended an air-to-water flow ratio of 30001 to remove ammonium ions The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of the stripping process for ammonium ion removal with air to water ratios of less than 30001The results of this study show that the air-to-water flow ratio is as low as 60. Ammonia is a very soluble gas in water. The design ensures that the air collects up to 985 of the ammonia gas into the air. Ammonia stripping is a simple desorption process used to lower the ammonia content of a wastewater stream. Air Stripping Tower Water Storage Wastewater Clear Water.</p>

<p>The presence of ammonia in wastewater can be found in two forms namely ammonium ions and ammonia gas. It is an environmental engineering technology used for the purification of groundwaters and wastewaters containing volatile compounds. The OxyStrip system has been used to strip ammonia from Leachate and VOCs and CO2 from groundwater that would destroy a typical air stripper in a matter of days.

Typical Air Stripping System Air stripping is a full-scale technology in which volatile organics are partitioned from ground water by greatly increasing the surface area of the contaminated water exposed to air. Actual design to obtain more than 90 ammonia-stripping eff iciency it has been recom- mended that the design air requirement be 15 times the theoretical value 14. The air is then passed directly to a thermal oxidiser where it is combusted destroying the ammonia and releasing nitrogen carbon dioxide and water to the atmosphere see Figure 2.

<p>Typical Air Stripping System Air stripping is a full-scale technology in which volatile organics are partitioned from ground water by greatly increasing the surface area of the contaminated water exposed to air. It is proved that the steam stripping shows better operability and economic performance than the air stripping. More-over the volatile andor adsorbable organically bound halogen compounds can be recovered in the distillate and they can be reused improving the sustainability. A sensitivity analysis was also done to make sure the column could withstand changing conditions like temperature and contaminant concentration.

<p>This report contains a summary of the design. In every application GCES considers all factors in selecting the optimum design. It is a process by which wastewater is contacted with air to strip the ammonia gas present in the wastewater. The OxyStrip system has been used to strip ammonia from Leachate and VOCs and CO2 from groundwater that would destroy a typical air stripper in a matter of days.
