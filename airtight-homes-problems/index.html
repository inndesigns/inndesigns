<p><strong>Airtight Homes Problems</strong>, Air and moisture can be forced into wall and ceiling cavities where water vapor condenses and fosters the growth of mold. We go on incessantly here about the importance of air barriers in home construction to reduce air leakage but no matter how hard you worked to make a house airtight if the pressure isnt balanced you will be sucking air in or forcing it out and despite your efforts making the inside environment. Most building damage occurs in this way. But when a home is too airtight it can affect the ventilation which can lead to.</p>
