<p>Is my go-to place when I need someone to help me do my essay. This sounds obvious but in the context of an integrated design team approach it can bring engineering skills and perspectives to bear at the concept design stage thereby helping the owner and architect avoid a sub-optimal design solution. Mathematical and computer-based models provide a foundation for explaining complex behaviour decision-making engineering design and for real-time simulators for research and training.
