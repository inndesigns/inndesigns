<p>Best thing on the television since Downton. Well written and I enjoyed the book very much. The acting is phenomenal and the series is very well written. A Place to Call Home had and has all the correct ingredients and a lot going for it on most levels but it is not outstandingly original and misses the mark too often to be regarded as.
