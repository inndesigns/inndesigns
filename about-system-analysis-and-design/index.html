<p>Systems analysis and Systems design. Systems analysis and design can help eliminate faults and errors within the completed system. System analysis is a procedure or approach that serves to determine the systems performance for a given known structure of this system. In addition to presenting a written analysis and design document for a software program it is sometimes helpful to use presentation software to add a graphical representation of the new software system.

<p>The development cycle repeats with analysis design and implementation of the next part and this repeats until the project is complete. Systems analysis a method of studying a system by examining its component parts and their interactions. The chapter then overviews the basic characteristics of object-oriented systems and the fundamentals of object-oriented systems analysis and design and closes with a description of the Unified Process and its extensions and the Unified Modeling Language. The systems analysis process is an iterative one that cycles repeatedly through the following interrelated and somewhat indistinct phases.
