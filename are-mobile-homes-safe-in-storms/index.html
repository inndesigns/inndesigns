<p>Storm Safety 101 In the Spring tornados on the east coast begin gearing up and can cause havoc for everyone especially those who have chosen mobile home living as their dwelling. Mobile homes built prior to the 1950s were used as temporary housing for workers who needed to travel far distances to work during WWII. Because mobile homes are not designed to withstand the force of a tornado or even straight-line winds common in severe storms its important that you leave the mobile home to find shelter elsewhere. On the April 13 Opinions page of the Citizen-Times it is stated that modular homes are not as safe in violent storms as conventionally built houses.

<p>But with the right precautions taken by homeowners and community managers manufactured homes are safer and more secure than ever before including in bad storms. Now one thing wed like to straighten out are the stereotypes behind a mobile home being considered an unsafe structure during a storm. In fact homes built to the HUD standard are generally safe but you want something built in 1994 or later to. The Manufactured Housing Institute MHI the national trade association for the factory-built housing industry is working to clear up the negative stereotypes about manufactured homes and inform the public that since 1976 they have been built.
