<p>A pedestrian bridge is a bridge designed for pedestrians. Bridges to Prosperity has modified construction practices and expanded flexibility in design alternatives and design process materials to ensure the suspended pedestrian bridge remains a locally sustainable option for communities in varying topographic and geographic regions of the world. The pedestrian bridge is a new crossing spanning over SW 8th Street. Analysis and Design Software SAP2000 was used to model analyze and design the pedestrian bridge due to the softwares flexibility that allows for linear nonlinear static and dynamic analysis and design of two and three dimensional structures as complicated as. Stabilize they should reasonably represent the hydrostatic ground-water level for that time and location.</p>
