<p><strong>At Home Chemical Reaction Experiments</strong>, You may have seen our CO2 experiments with baking soda vinegar&ndash; this lab covers what many kids think of as chemistry &ndash; mixing substances together. During the reaction carbon dioxide is released. The scenario of this virtual experiment is that there was a spill into a river and the user has to determine the downstream concentrations of acid following an acid spill at a conservation site. Fill the canister with warm water and then quickly put the cap on and watch the acid-base reaction.</p>

<p>This simulation uses HCl and NaOH but following the structured calculations included the students could then return to their own experiments and determine the concentration of acid in their samples if the. The sweet almond oil is released during this reaction. Since we are all spending more time at home we thought it would be fun to share some easy at-home science experiments to do with the kidsYou mightve seen our first experiment where we explained what acids and bases are and how to use red cabbage to tell whether liquids are acidic or basicThe experiment we are doing today is all about chemical reactions that you can see. A fun TWIST on the egg with vinegar experiment. Make paper into a moving worm.</p>
