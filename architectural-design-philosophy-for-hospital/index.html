<p>We gave our architects BDP a detailed brief defining the key characteristics we wanted to incorporate. Our philosophy is to build a relationship with each child and understand his or her trauma says Alexandria Lewis EdD the VTCC facilitys executive director. That flexible design philosophy can be observed in many of its projects especially for the healthcare industry one of the biggest sectors it serves. But in a very practical sense persuasive design philosophy has simply provided a framework for defining which design choices are considered valuable and which are not.
