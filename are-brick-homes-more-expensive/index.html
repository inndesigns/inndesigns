<p>The cons of buying or building a brick home are few. In fact the two methods are generally considered to be very similar in terms of total material and labour costs. According to the Brick Industry Association a 2500-square-foot brick home typically costs 6 to 7 percent more than vinyl. It will take 3 to 5 days to complete at 70 an hour for a total cost between 9880 to 13250 for a 1000 square foot house or addition.
