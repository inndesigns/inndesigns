<p>DIG outlines several use cases for designing and deploying resilient plant-wide architectures for IACS app lications. From this experience we have identiﬁed best practices and core strategies for architecting systems in the cloud. Unlock the fastest path to value on AWS enterprises must consider how to industrialize the application delivery process across each layer of the cloud embracing the cloud operating model and tuning people process and tools to it. AWS Well-Architected helps cloud architects build secure high-performing resilient and efficient infrastructure for their applications and workloads. By using the Framework you will learn current architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable secure efficient and cost-effective workloads in the cloud.</p>
