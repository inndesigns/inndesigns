<p>Can be tested and checked. Advantages of using qualitative data analysis software include being freed from manual and clerical tasks saving time being able to deal with large amounts of qualitative data having increased flexibility and having improved validity and auditability of qualitative research. A research design is important in that it enables the assessment to be result-full as possible thereby producing enough information. The cost of data analytics tools vary based on applications and features supported. Processing Information directly from its source.</p>

<p>The Descriptive Analysis is criticized for its incapability to show cause and effect and predictions for example the relationship between two variables cannot be concluded as causal relationship. Answer the what not the why. The research design can be structured along experimentation exploration descriptive and analysis. Furthermore the Quality by Design approach for optimizing formulation methods has several advantages such as reducing the number of experiments cost-effectiveness and considerably less.
