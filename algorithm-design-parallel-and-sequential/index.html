<p><strong>Algorithm Design Parallel And Sequential</strong>, Analysis of computation granularity. The emphasis is on fundamental algorithmic concepts applicable across a wide variety of problem domains and transferable across a reasonably broad set of programming languages and computer architectures. A sequential algorithm is evaluated by its runtime in general asymptotic runtime as a function of input size. The application consists of a set of processes with separate address spaces.</p>
