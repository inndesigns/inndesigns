<p><strong>Apple Mouse Design Flaw</strong>, Apples child safety plan has a major design flaw A little-discussed feature of Apples plan to limit the spread of child sexual abuse material uses design elements shown by research to backfire. If it was a design flaw all or most would be failing. After taking years of criticism for their continuation of the one-button mouse Apple effectively flipped the design of a normal mouse upside-down with the sleekly featureless appearance that resulted inspiring its jocular appellation as the first zero-button mouse. I had this problem too turns out a slight design flaw with the mouse is that smaller batteries come loose and power is lost so the bluetooth dies.</p>
