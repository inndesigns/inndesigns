<p>I am wondering if anyone knows any sights on the net where plans for an airboat hull are available. While it works well in heavy seas the drawbacks include reduced interior volume forward and a very wet ride because the waves come up and over the bow as a matter of course. In addition to these standard models we are ready to design unique HMWP models to meet your special needs. Airboats in general make use of the same distinct design and special engineering attributes first presented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1905 in Nova Scotia Canada.
