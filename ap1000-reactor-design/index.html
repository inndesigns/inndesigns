<p>For nearly two decades Westinghouse has pursued an improved pressurized water reactor PWR design. The result of this commitment is the AP1000 a simpler and more economical PWR. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has recently reached two milestones related to the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor design but were still months away from any final decisions on these matters. For nearly two decades Westinghouse has pursued an improved pressurized water reactor PWR design. The AP1000 Nuclear Reactor Design Executive Summary The AP1000 advanced passive nuclear reactor design has a weaker containment and fewer back-up safety systems than current reactor designs.</p>

The AP1000 is the safest and most economical nuclear power plant available in the worldwide commercial marketplace and is the only Generation III reactor to receive a design certification from the US. In this slide the NRC has fixated on liner corrosion rather than dealing with numerous and varied containment system failures in the current generation of nuclear power plants. But unlike other PWR designs it is what is called an advanced passive design.
