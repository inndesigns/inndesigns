<p>The differential case has bearings that rotate two axle shafts. Analysis is done on the differential by applying tangential and static loads. A vehicles wheels rotate at different speeds mainly when turning corners. The main motive behind designing the new differential mounts for K4 was to reduce the weight of the car as much as possible without compromising the strength.</p>

<p>With fast pacing development of automobile industry and growing needs for better driving experience NVH performance has become an important aspect of analysis in new driveline product development especially in hybrid and electric powered vehicles. These all-wheel-drive vehicles need a differential between each set of drive wheels and they. Thi s differential mak es use of Invex satellit e and side gears which mechanically re sist. On the inner ends of each axle a smaller bevel gear called differential side gear is mounted. In rear-wheel drive cars the differential converts rotational motion of the transmission shaft which lies parallel to the cars motion to rotational motion of the half-shafts on the ends of which are the wheels which lie perpendicular to the cars motion.</p>

<p>It only comes into play when one wheel needs to rotate differentially with respect to its counterpart. The differential is a device that splits the engine torque two ways allowing each output to spin at a different speed. In vehicles without a differential such as karts both driving wheels are forced to rotate at the same speed usually on a common axle driven by a simple chain-drive mechanism.
