<p>For many years I tried to design a shooting board and bench hook that would be worthy of publishing in Popular Woodworking Magazine. Of the bench to be used as a bench hook for cutting stock to length. The fence has a hole to capture miter jigs. The wood is held in position by the left hand whilst the right hand guides the saw so that the saw groove is straight for left handed people - the other way round Concentration is very important.
