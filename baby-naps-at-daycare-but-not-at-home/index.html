<p>For a while we were still giving him 2 naps at home because hes pretty OT from the week at daycare and he would do about 145-2hrs at about 930am and then another short 30-45min nap around. This can help to gradually acclimate your baby to whats coming and might help ward-off over tiredness. We dont try to be silent or anything but shes our only baby and its just not the same environment as daycare. Im getting so frustrated with our daycare because my baby girl gets very little sleep when shes there.
