<p><strong>Axial Engine Design</strong>, Because the axial and transverse motor designs can have the rotating member located on their outer diameter they create higher torque while reducing their motor footprint. This means for the same permanent magnet and copper winding provision you get more torque. Ultimately we ended up with a double stator single rotor Axial Flux brushless motor. The motors higher power density means that a smaller axial motor can be used compared to a radial motor.</p>

While YASA Saietta and Magnax all claim that axial-flux technology is the way to go radial motor designs still hold their own in. Each OEM is looking at specific configurations as the different size and form factor of the axial motor changes the design of an EV. 5 cylinders require only 3 spark plugs but have as many power strokes per rotation as a 6 cylinder traditional. This aspect of axial-flux motor design typically deli vers a 30 torque density advantage over a conventional radial motor.</p>
