<p>Digital Principles and System Design - Asynchronous Sequential Circuits There are a number of steps that must be carried out in order to minimize the circuit complexity and to produce a stable circuit without critical races. Now the difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous Circuits is in how the circuit goes for one Internal State to the Next Internal State. The traditional configuration of asynchronous circuits is using one or more feedback loops No real delay elements It is more convenient to employ the SR latch as a memory element in asynchronous circuits Produce an orderly pattern in the logic diagram with the memory elements clearly visible SR latch is also an asynchronous circuit.

Those curriculums that do mention asynchronous design do so only in passing. ASYNCHRONOUS DESIGN CONCEPT The basic idea behind asynchronous design is that a digital circuit is asynchronous when no clock is used to implement sequencing.
