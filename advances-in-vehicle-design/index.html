<p>Advances in Vehicle Design is an introduction to vehicle and body systems in the sense of providing readers with an insight into analytical methods given in a wide variety of published sources such as technical journals conference papers and proceedings of engineering institutions for which a comprehensive list of references is provided. Synthesis Lectures on Advances in Auto-motive Technology Series is intended to introduce such new transformational technologies in the automotive industry to its readers. An essentially pragmatic approach the Airflow also kept the traditional Body On Frame BOF front-engine RWD standard but made some significant advances in terms vehicle design by pushing the engine further forward over the front wheels. Recent work is described that extends design synthesis and optimisation to cover a far wider range of air-vehicle concepts and links concept design optimisation to multi-disciplinary analysis and optimisation. This combined with a wider body dramatically improved interior space and accommodations.</p>
