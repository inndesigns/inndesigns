<p><strong>Architectural Theories Of Design</strong>, Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola 44 from Preface to Rules of the Five Orders of Architecture 1562 18. Theory is the mode of design that applies the architectural design constructs to the proposed reality. Such trends have an impact on the design process without people talking about these changes in terms of design methods. This Chapter examines how the ideas of Darwinian selec-tion might apply to architecture.</p>

Do you know how bridges and towers work. It was during this time period that architectural theories first rejected the imitation of the old types of structures and outlined the importance of functionalism rather than merely design.</p>
