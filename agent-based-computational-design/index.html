<p>Every agent in ABCE must inherit from the abceAgent class. Overview of Agent-Based Computational Economics Agent-based computational economics ACE eg Tesfatsion 2005 is an emerging alternative approach to classical economic theory that is often applied to the study of market behavior. Because trade and give involve a form of interaction between the agents they run over several sub-rounds.

<p>Roland Rust PhD Discusses His Interest in Agent-Based Modeling Start Time. The methodology of agent-based computational economics is useful to study the processes behind the emergence of equilibria and the general unfolding of patterns in the economy. Such systems often self-organize themselves and create emergent order. Uncertainty and the complexity of urban environment raise doubts about static and solid decisions in the field of urban design. The MASS library is a parallel-computing library developed by Professor Fukuda and DSL.</p>
