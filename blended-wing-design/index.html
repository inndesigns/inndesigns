<p>Answer 1 of 3. The Blended Wing Body BWB is a tailless design that integrates the wing and the fuselage and was initially conceived towards the end of the 20th century to serve as a novel platform for high-speed subsonic commercial airliners In the general case it consists of a middle section center body or fuselage and an outer section wing whereas the part in between is the blending area where. Click the File menu on the dialog box and then import the stl flie. As the old adage goes. The radical Blended Wing design has been developed by Boeing in cooperation with the NASA Langley Research Center.</p>
