<p><strong>Ball Check Valve Seat Design</strong>, A Ball Check Valve is a simple and reliable valve with the only moving part to block the reverse flow is a spherical ball. BALL CHECK VALVE The function of ball check valves is similar to the piston check but the ball check valves use a ball inside the body to control the movement of flow. Ball checks are typically found in smaller sizes of 2. A double-disc or wafer check valve consists of two half-circle disks hinged together.</p>

<p>The double piston effect seat design in the API 6D is also called the Double-Isolation-and-Bleed Valve DIB Valve. When choosing an industrial valve you will face numerous choices. These valves are specifically designed for high wear applications such as slurry ash disposal and mine-dewatering. The diameter of the through hole is determined by the required flow rate which is in turn dictated by the Reynolds number the fluid pressure and the Kinematic viscosity of the solution or gas.</p>

<p>Due to its simple flow efficient and virtually maintenance-free design the valve is. Ball valve design in which the ball is not rigidly held on its rotational axis is free to float between the seat rings. The large port design prevents clogging while the HI-WEAR seat offers a large sealing area. The Ball valve and seat for HPLC can be customized as per customers drawing design and specifications.

<p>The ball rotates with the valve stem to achieve the opening and closing action. The diameter of the through hole is determined by the required flow rate which is in turn dictated by the Reynolds number the fluid pressure and the Kinematic viscosity of the solution or gas. Designing a ball check valve starts with the diameter of the through hole. AVK ball check valves are self-cleaning as the ball rotates during operation which eliminates the risk of impurities getting stuck on the ball.

<p>Ball valve design in which the ball is not rigidly held on its rotational axis is free to float between the seat rings. A floating design ball valve sandwiches the hollow ball between two or more cupped seats that form a tight seal between the body and the ball at the inlet and outlet ports of the valve body. However like all other valves ball valves are generally rated at a lower pressure for steam service than for liquid or dry gaseous service.
