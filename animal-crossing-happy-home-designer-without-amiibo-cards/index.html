<p>Happy Home Designer is the first game to make use of amiibo cards which launches alongside the first series of cards later this fall.

It should be of no surprise really then that the new DLC has amiibo functionality but youd be forgiven for thinking otherwise as at first there is no obvious way to use amiibo.
