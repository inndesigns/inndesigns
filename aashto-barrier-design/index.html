<p>Also the AASHTO Green Book may be of service to you. Design per AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications section A133 for Concrete Railings Exceptions to the cases described above may occur with approval from the Bridge Design Engineer andor the State Geotechnical Engineer. Traffic safety barriers as well as median barriers bicycle and pedestrian railings. W-Beam Guardrail is a semi-rigid barrier that utilises continuous beam action ensuring consistent performance and reduced deflections when compared to more flexible barriers.

<p>Current direction is to design per TL level Test Level. The content of the AASHTO Guide Specifications for design of sound barriers is not consistent with the requirements of the AASHTO LRFD bridge design specifications. Departments of Transportation adopted the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications during the year 2007 which is mandated by AASHTO and FHWA.
