<p>The FPGA vendor on the other hand normally has no direct responsibility after delivering the unprogrammed devices. Generally an ASIC design will be undertaken for a product that will have a large production run and the ASIC may contain a very large part of the electronics needed on a single integrated circuit. To overcome the challenges yet realize the opportunities presented by semiconductor densities and capabilities electronic product companies utilize a System-on-a-Chip SoC design methodology which incorporates pre-designed components also called SoC Intellectual. THE MASKED GATE ARRAY ASIC An Application Specific Integrated Circuit or ASIC is a chip that can be designed by an engineer with no particular knowledge of semiconductor physics or semiconductor processes.</p>

<p>AP7202 ASIC AND FPGA DESIGN. It involves about seven different stages from system specification to tape out for fabrication. An FPGA will require shallow combinatorial gate depth to get high speed ASIC is more forgiving. This course will help you avoid the most common design mistakes of FPGA designers. In view of the cost they are not used in cheap high volume products but instead FPGAs find applications in a variety of areas where complex logic circuitry may be needed and.</p>
