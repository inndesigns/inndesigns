<p>For LC1 permanent load change the Internal forces so that you input the values of shear force and bending moment at the point of the opening. The design of concrete beam includes the estimation of cross section dimension and reinforcement area to resist applied loads. To investigate the problem of openings in beams the author initiated a research program in the early 1980s. Concrete Beams with Openings.
