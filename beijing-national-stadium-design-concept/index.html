<p>The architects had not thought about a bird or a nest. In addition the stadiums retractable roof design plan was taken out for safety and cost reasons due to the collapse of a roof at the Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris which had the same roof structure as that designed for Beijing National Stadium. The design concept for the National Stadium came from a complete emptiness when Herzog de Meuron and I were talking about the initial plan before we started on the actual design. To maintain the atmosphere and provide a superb stadium experience the roof was clad with ethyl tetrofluoroethylene ETFE panels on the upper surface and an acoustic membrane on the lower surface. 3 D Models Beijing National Stadium Architecture Design Concept National Stadium.</p>

<p>In 2001 Beijing City selected Herzog De Meurons Bird nest as the best arena design In 2003 their scheme became the official national stadium for the 2008 Summer Olympics. The requirements for its design were that it had to be inspiring and be able to withstand an earthquake. Now the architects faced the challenge of transforming this highly ambitious project into a reality. The design is revolving on the nests of birds not solely.
