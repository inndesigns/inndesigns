<p>If you have a guideline policy or best practice that you can share on this site please contact our ArchRS co-chairs. Architectural design and construction records are valuable sources for understanding and preserving the built environment. Architect of Record is the architect or architecture firm whose name appears on a building permit issued for a specific project on which that architect or firm performed services. When we complete and close-out each project copies of the digital files will be stored as archives both locally on a dedicated hard drive and remotely on the cloud.
