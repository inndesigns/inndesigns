<p><strong>Assessment Research Design</strong>, Research design is a plan to answer your research question. The assessment seeks to build capacity to apply information to multiple contexts to provide an early opportunity for feedback on understanding and to build secondary research skills. Assessment should appear relevant and authentic and wherever possible allowed students to draw on their personal experience and to exercise choice with regard to topics. Giving students an assessment of knowledge the first day of class and giving the same assessment on the last day of class is an example of a research design based on a single-sample repeated measures.</p>
