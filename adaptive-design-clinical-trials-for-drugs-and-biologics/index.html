By casting dose finding as a Bayesian model selection problem we propose an adaptive design by simultaneously incorporating the toxicity and efficacy outcomes to select the optimal biological dose OBD in phase III clinical trials. Specifically sponsors will be able to design trials that can be modified at preplanned stages with less risk of compromising the integrity of the data and any conclusions.
