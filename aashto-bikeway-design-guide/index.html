An 18 mph design speed will cover most users based on the AASHTO Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities. Despite the legislative and federal resources to promote bicycling key design guidance continued to echo the desires of vehicular cyclists and their right to the road up until the fourth edition of AASHTOs Guide for the Development of Bicycle Facilities 2012 which reintroduced bikeways with more physical separation but still emphasized design for the confident bicyclist.
