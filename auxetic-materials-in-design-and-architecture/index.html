<p>Auxetic materials are characterized by the uncommon capacity of extending sideways when pulled longitudinally while contracting laterally under compressive action. This occurs due to their particular internal structure and the way this deforms when the sample is uniaxially loaded.

Abstract As typical mechanical metamaterials with negative Poissons ratios auxetic metamaterials exhibit counterintuitive auxetic behaviors that are highly dependent on their geometric arrangements.

<p>Typology of curvature 2a. Nanotechnology is pushing materials science beyond the limits of what once seemed impossibleWhen combined with ultra-high-strength concrete nanomaterials such as. Auxetic Structures are a class of meta-materials uniquely characterised by their Negative Poissons Ratio thus when a lateral force is applied the structure expands longitudinally becoming thicker and stronger perpendicular to the strain.
