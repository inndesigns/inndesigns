<p>Here the signal is attenuated or damped at low frequencies with the output increasing at 20dBDecade 6dBOctave until the frequency reaches the cut-off point Æc where again R XcIt has a response curve that extends down from infinity to the cut-off. Use 01 ÂµF capacitors 2 1 c RCLL Ï 1 1 c RCHH. As the name implies a high pass filter is a form of filter used in electronic circuit design that passes the higher frequencies and rejects those at lower frequencies. A high pass filter also known as a low-cut filter or bass-cut filter is an electronic filter that permits signals with a frequency higher than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than that cutoff frequency.
