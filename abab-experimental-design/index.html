<p>Reversal designs share the same advantages as AB designs but also include a withdrawal of treatment to verify treatment effects and a re-implementation of the treatment to replicate the treatment results an ABAB reversal design. Designs with an especially clear demonstration of experimental control. Welcome to Behaviorbabe - Single Subject Designs - This site was created for multiple reasons. The ABAB design is intended to reveal a functional relationship between an experimental treatment and a behavior targeted for change. ABA therapy utilizes behavioral principles to set goals reinforce behaviors and measure outcomes.</p>

<p>PC ABAB Reversal Graph. Additionally many clinicianseducators prefer the ABAB design because the investigation ends with a treatment phase rather than the absence of an intervention. ABA designs typically start with a baseline period where behaviour is monitored before an intervention stage where behaviour is monitored whilst a treatment is administered. The ABAB design is superior to the ABA design because a single reversal is not strong enough for the effectiveness of the treatment. Ace Lab.</p>
