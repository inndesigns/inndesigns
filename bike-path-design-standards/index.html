Summary of Design Principles for Good Bicycle Infrastructure 7 May 2020 21 Principle Rationale Source Lighting Bicycle Paths or shared paths that carry substantial numbers of cyclists between dawn and dusk should be lit in accordance with lighting level P2 or higher. These types of facilities are explained in more detail in this cycling section of the AT Code Of Practice ATCOP. The two most important considerations that should be made when designing a bicycle path are safety and accessibility. No national standards or guidelines dictate RWT facility design.</p>
