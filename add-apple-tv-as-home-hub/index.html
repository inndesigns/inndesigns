<p>Apple TV 3rd generation or later HomePod and iPads running iOS 9 or above. If you dont see HomeKit then your Apple TV isnt connected as a home hub. If you have a compatible model make sure that its updated with the latest tvOS and you should be good to go. Both Apple TV models work equally well as a Home Hub.

<p>Home is where the hub is. Tried to setup Apple TV 3rd generation as a home hub but it just dont pop up in the Home app hubs. Using an Apple TV as a Home Hub An Apple TV will set you back 150 for the HD version or 180 for the 4K version. I got some lights and set them up in the home app but when I was doing that it asked me if I wanted to add myself to the Apple TV to use it as a hub. Pin On Home.</p>
