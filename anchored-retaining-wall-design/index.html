<p><strong>Anchored Retaining Wall Design</strong>, The design of retaining walls is not an every-day design task. Given the height H of the retaining wall we can assume or counter check our initial design considerations should at least according to the following geometric proportions. The walls built are commonly between the range of 1 5 meters in height. Cantilever walls are usually used as floodwall or as earth retaining walls with low wall heights 10 to 15 feet or less.</p>

<p>Given the height H of the retaining wall we can assume or counter check our initial design considerations should at least according to the following geometric proportions. For inner-city applications anchored walls are often more aesthetically pleasing since they can be designed to meet a specific sites particular need while still allowing for the planting of ground cover on top of them. Anchors are installed into the ground to balance the foundation and the load is then supported by the retaining walls held in place by strong cables connecting the anchors and walls.

<p>The walls built are commonly between the range of 1 5 meters in height. Anchored walls cost less than non-anchored retaining walls since they require fewer materials and less equipment to construct. Also called a tie-back system an anchored retaining wall basically consists of anchors cables and thin walls. Because cantilever walls derive their support solely from the foundation soils they may be installed in relatively close proximity but not less than 15 times the overall length of the piling to existing structures.

<p>The active wedge of soil immediately behind the wall has an additional pseudo-static force component equal to the mass of soil within the wedge multiplied by acceleration. And our broad experience means we can quickly cost various alternatives and advise on the finished look and design. Cantilever walls are usually used as floodwall or as earth retaining walls with low wall heights 10 to 15 feet or less.
